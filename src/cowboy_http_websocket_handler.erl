%% @doc Handler for HTTP WebSocket requests.
%%
%% WebSocket handlers must implement three callbacks: <em>websocket_init/3</em>,
%% <em>websocket_handle/3</em> and <em>websocket_terminate/3</em>. These
%% callbacks will only be called if the connection is upgraded to WebSocket
%% in the HTTP handler's <em>init/3</em> callback. They are then called in that
%% order, although <em>websocket_handle/3</em> will be called multiple time,
%% one time for each message or packet received.
%%
%% <em>websocket_init/3</em> is meant for initialization. It receives
%% information about the transport and protocol used, along with the handler
%% options from the dispatch list. You can define a request-wide state here.
%% If you are going to want to compact the request, you should probably do it
%% here.
%%
%% <em>websocket_handle/3</em> receives messages sent to the process and
%% also the data sent to the socket. In the later case the information is
%% given as a tuple <em>{websocket, Data}</em>. It can reply something, do
%% nothing or close the connection. You can choose to hibernate the process
%% by returning <em>hibernate</em> to save memory and CPU.
%%
%% <em>websocket_terminate/3</em> is meant for cleaning up. It also receives
%% the request and the state previously defined, along with a reason for
%% termination.
