%% @doc Routing middleware.
%%
%% Resolve the handler to be used for the request based on the
%% routing information found in the <em>dispatch</em> environment value.
%% When found, the handler module and associated data are added to
%% the environment as the <em>handler</em> and <em>handler_opts</em> values
%% respectively.
%%
%% If the route cannot be found, processing stops with either
%% a 400 or a 404 reply.
